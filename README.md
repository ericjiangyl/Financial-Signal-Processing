### Project 1
Analyze the market data with year 2006 and year 2008 using Markowitz portfolio theory. Construct the theoratical market portfolio, Minimum variance portfolio using S&P500 and comparing its performance with Navie portfolio and some other portfolios with random weights.

### Project 2
Using Matlab to simulate Brownian motion and apply it to the binomial asset pricing model

### Project 3
More simulations on stochastic calculus. Using it to simulate Q1 Stochastic Differential Equations, Q2 Interest Rate Models, Q3 Corrolated Brownian Motions, Q4 Volatility in SDEs
